To run this application upon cloning you must install all the dependencies needed to run. In the terminal run the command npm i -S webpack webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin node-sass sass-loader resolve-url-loader css-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react babel-preset-env babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread react react-dom eslint eslint-plugin-react react-browser-router react-dom redux history react-router react-router-dom jest react-test-renderer react-redux. This will install all the things needed. Then in package.json make sure jest is in the test script. Also add a watch script with 'webpack-dev-server --inline --hot' and a build script with 'webpack'. Then run npm run watch in the terminal. You will now have to open up localhost:8080 in your browser. Add a category name and budget. Then add an expense name and price and it will subtract from the budget left with each new expense. Then to test run npm test in the terminal. Again make sure that jest is in the test script for package.json.
